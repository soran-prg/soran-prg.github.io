I am interested in analyzing and integrating diverse satellite geodetic measurements for monitoring variations in the Earth's shape and gravity field—from global to local scales—and enhancing our understanding of Earth system dynamics concerning lithosphere, cryosphere and hydrosphere.\nMy research interests are focused on utilizing SAR Interferometry and GNSS/GPS techniques for monitoring ice-sheet motion and measuring Earth's surface displacements caused by natural hazards and anthropogenic activities; investigating the Earth structure through physical geodesy and Earth's gravity field recovery based upon satellite gravimetry (GRACE/GRACE-FO and GOCE); and deploying numerical/analytical approaches, adjustment theory and time series analysis for geodetic modeling.\nCurrently, I am working on Glacial Isostatic Adjustment (GIA) modeling for investigating the implications of ice sheets on Earth system dynamics and developing GIA models in different regions based on numerical modeling and combination of various data sources regarding the Earth rheology and ice history (e.g. geomorphological evidence, tide gauge records and satellite geodetic measurements), thereby enhancing the estimation of tectonic signals, distinguishing between climatic and non-climatic sea level fluctuations, constraining the rheological properties of the Earth's interior (e.g. lateral variations in viscosity and lithospheric thickness), reconstructing the regional seal level for a glacial cycle, and determining the main contributing factors and mechanisms to the past and present sea level changes and examining their contributions to the future sea level changes. To shed light on this topic, GIA accounts for the adjustment process of the Earth to an equilibrium state once burdened by glaciers and ice sheets. GIA impacts upon the Earth system dynamics and occasions a global pattern of sea level change, variations of the Earth's gravitational field, crustal deformation and fluctuations of the Earth's center of mass and the Earth's rotation. Consequently, GIA modeling supplies an invaluable source for assessing global warming effects and climate change, ice sheet evolution, natural hazards, and the Earth structure and its rheology. In recent years, satellite geodetic techniques have played an increasingly drastic role in constraining GIA signals in different regions with complex rheologies, such as Greenland and Antarctica, and improving the 3-D Earth models. I am very enthusiastic about developing and calibrating GIA models through numerical approaches (e.g. finite element) and integrating diverse geodetic sources including tide gauge, satellite altimetry, InSAR-derived displacement field, GPS/GNSS measurements and GRACE garvimetry. Due to the fact that these data sets have different sensitivities to GIA, they can be combined with each other so as to correct the GIA signals and investigate the effective mechanisms for ice sheet and sea level changes from past to future. To exemplify, combination of continuous GPS observations characterized by high temporal resolution with differential InSAR techniques having high spatial resolution for the purpose of supplying more constraints on solid earth deformation rates, and integration of GRACE measurements determining the mass change associated with the mass redistribution in atmosphere, oceans, solid Earth and ice sheets into satellite altimetry detecting the surface elevation variation derived from ice volume change and solid Earth deformation for correcting GIA signals and quantifying the past and present ice mass changes and the non-GIA-induced mass redistribution, especially in areas where the ice sheets currently exist.\n ","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"taxonomy","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"2525497d367e79493fd32b198b28f040","permalink":"https://www.soran-prg.github.io/authors/admin/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/authors/admin/","section":"authors","summary":"I am a Ph.D. candidate and research assistant working under the supervision of Prof. Glenn A.

According to this algorithm, the topography of the interface density can be estimated by an iterative inversion procedure. The first approximation of the topography interface is computed by assigning h(x)=0. Iteratively, the value of h(x) is used in the equation to calculate a new estimate of h(x) until a reasonable solution is acquired. Due to the fact that the Parker-Oldenburg inversion method is unstable at high frequencies, a cosine low pass filter is utilized for constraining high frequency signals and series convergence. The high-cut filter (HCF) is defined as follows (WH and SH are the cut-off frequencies):  $$HCF(k)=\\frac{1}{2}[1+\\cos(\\frac{k-2\\pi \\times WH}{2 \\times (SH-WH)})] \\ \\ for \\ \\ WH \\lt k \\lt SH$$\n$$HCF(k)=0 \\ \\ for \\ \\ k \\gt SH$$\n$$HCF(k)=1 \\ \\ for \\ \\ k \\lt WH$$\nIt should be noted that when the difference between two successive approximations is lower than a convergence criterion or when a certain number of iterations is obtained, the iterative procedure will be terminated.

Generally speaking, a deeper source produces gravity anomalies with longer wavelength than a shallower source with the same size and density. In this study, in order to distinguish between deeper and shallower sources and do away with Bouguer anomalies with short wavelengths associated with shallow crustal sources, the radially averaged power spectrum of the complete Bouguer data has been calculated by Fourier analysis. Considering the log of power of the Bouguer gravity spectrum as a function of wavenumber, the mean depth of the interfaces is estimated by the power spectrum analysis. According to the plot of logarithm of the spectral energy against wavenumber, the spectral energy decays as the wavenumber increases. Mainly, this decay process is controlled by the ensemble average depth of the random distribution of sources, which can be predicted by detecting the linear trends of the plot and fitting a linear function to each segment concerning residual or regional anomalies. The mean depth of the interfaces equals the half of the slope of the segments (Spector \u0026amp; Grant (1970)). The reference level (z0) for the Parker-Oldenburg inversion approach and cut-off wavelengths for differentiating the regional complete Bouguer anomaly (high wavelength anomalies corresponding to deep sources), which is utilized for the Moho depth estimation, from the residual one (short wavelength anomalies relating to shallow sources) have been derived from the power spectral analysis results.

The Moho depth in different zones of Iran has been estimated by various approaches like analysis of receiver function method according to teleseismic waves recorded in seismic stations; inversion of terrestrial gravity data and using Bouguer gravity anomaly and free air gravity anomaly; spectral correlation analysis of terrain gravity effects; thermal analysis and using geoid height; Parker-Oldenburg method; Least squares Collection. For instance, the first of crustal thickness variations have been computed from Bouguer anomaly modelling by Dehghani \u0026amp; Makris (1984) for the whole Iran. Based on their results, crustal thickness is 55 km beneath the main Zagros thrust, 45–48 km in eastern Iran and 35 km below the Alborz mountains. In this study, a new approach was used to estimate the Moho depth in structural zones of Iran based on geopotential models and 3D Euler Deconvolution method. The Euler Deconvolution method is a semi-automated process and supports the interpretation of magnetic field data, gravimetry data or gravity gradiometry data. It is used to estimate the location of the source of a magnetic or a gravity field anomaly. Euler Deconvolution method is not dependent on an initial depth or density limitations (Reid et al., 1990; Mushayandebvu et al., 2001). Based on Keating (1998) and Silva \u0026amp; Barbosa (2003), this algorithm is proper to determine depth of vertical and horizontal contacts, so it is good to be used in estimating the crust-mantle boundary (Moho depth).\nThompson (1982) showed that Euler's homogeneity relation could be written in the form:\n $$(x-x_0)\\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial x} + (y-y_0)\\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial y} +(z-z_0)\\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial z} = N(B-T)$$\nWhere (x0, y0, z0) is the position of a source whose total field T, is detected at (x, y, z). The total field has a regional or background value B. N is the degree of homogeneity, interpreted physically as the fall-off rate with distance and geophysically as a Structural Index (SI), Structural Index can change from 0 to 2 for gravity data. Because of high volume of data used in magnetic or gravimetric methods and lack of access to high precision and quality in overall processing of data in whole grid, Euler square window has been defined according to:    Euler Deconvolution Algorithm   The process is done inside the window and unknown parameters (B, x0, y0, z0) are calculated using least squares adjustment. This window must have two characteristics (Barbosa et al., 1999): 1. It should be large enough to incorporate substantial variation of the field and field gradient.; 2. It should be small enough not to include significant effects from multiple sources.\nMushayandebvu et al. (2004) studied influence of structural index on depth uncertainty and source position using a synthetic anomaly. Their studies show that an estimated depth for an anomaly may considerably change following structural index changes while location (or horizontal) uncertainties (Xoffset, Yoffset) won't change much. Although it is possible to have same anomaly using two structural indices, estimating depth of each structural index will be completely different. Another important parameter is window size which influence estimated depth in each solution. Generally speaking, solutions with much bigger or much smaller depths than window size are not acceptable, in these situations the resulted source cannot fit on geometry of hypothetical model. Reid et al. (1990) studied relation between anomalous depth and window size, they found out that the minimum acceptable depth is equal to window size and its maximum is about three times the window size. Barbosa et al. (2000) showed that it is possible to calculate (x0, y0) parameters (horizontal position of source) through selection of proper window size according to the model with no attention to N. But to calculate depth parameter (z0) which is the most important parameter in interpretation of gravity data, selection of structural index must be done precisely. Window size is a function of model depth and smaller window size provides larger errors for deeper depth because deeper masses have wider anomaly which in order to be included, the window must be wider. In simpler words, small windows deliver proper solutions for shallow anomalies while large windows provide small errors in depth estimation of deep masses.\nGeopotential models provide homogeneous and uniformly accurate information on the long wavelengths of the earth's gravity field. Since these Models have long wavelengths of gravity field, they are very suitable in determining Moho depth because short and middle wavelengths are not useful in this case. Accuracy of the geopotential models are usually evaluated by comparing the geoidal heights derived from the models with those of the local GPS-Leveling stations. After comparing EIGEN-GL04C model to GPS-Leveling data, it has been chosen as the most accurate model in Iran. In this research, free air gravity anomaly from EIGEN-GL04C model (Up to degree and order of 360; Long wavelengths of gravity field) as the total field (T) and ETOPO1 Model for considering topography effect were used for estimating Moho depth.\n   Free air gravity anomaly resulted from EIGEN-GL04C (The Zagros Zone)     Topography resulted from ETOPO1 (The Zagros Zone)   A lot of research has been done about relationship between anomalous depth and spherical harmonic degree. Bowin (1983) showed that second- and third-degree spherical harmonics are related to sources near to mantle-core boundary. Also Hager (1984) showed that fourth- to ninth-degree spherical harmonics are in relation with density models of subducted slab. Although it is not possible to calculate radial distribution of anomalous masses uniquely, but it is known that deeper and bigger sources produce lower degree harmonics of gravity field while higher degree harmonics are produced by shallow and smaller sources (Jackson et al., 1991). According to Bowin et al. (1986) studies, maximum depth of sensitivity for each degree of spherical harmonic is defined as Zmax= rc/(n-1); rc is radius of earth, n is the degree of spherical harmonic and Zmax is the maximum depth of sensitivity; On the other hand λ (Wavelength)=2πrc/n. Since this study aims to find Moho depth (depth of crust-mantle boundary), it can be said the desired depths are below 100 km, so there is a need to use a high pass filter to remove the effect of low frequencies which belong to deep masses, in other words to remove the influence of masses close to the mantle-core boundary and pass high frequencies. In the following figures, free air gravity anomaly and its derivatives in three directions after using a high pass filter with cut-off wavelength of 1000 km are shown. The X and Y derivatives were calculated in the spatial domain using a simple nine-point convolution filter and the Z derivative was computed in the frequency domain using Fast Fourier Transform (FFT).\n   High pass filtered free air gravity anomaly (The Zagros Zone); cut-off wavelength of 1000 km     The X derivative     The Y derivative     The Z derivative   The Moho depth in the Structural Zones of Iran (Zagros Fold \u0026amp; Thrust Belt, Sanandaj-Sirjan Zone, Alborz, Central Domain, Kopeh Dagh) was estimated by Euler Deconvolution method for 15 km to 55 km window sizes and 0 to 2 structural indices. the best window size and structural index in the structural zones were determined by comparing depths from Euler Deconvolution method and those of seismic studies (receiver function method) in 14 seismic stations of the studied region, then the results were compared to CRUST2.0 model and other research works. In the Zagros zone, the results show that for a window size of 40-45 km and structural index of 0.5 the best Moho depth is estimated using Euler Deconvolution algorithm. The following figure shows the results of estimating Moho depth by Euler Deconvolution method for window sizes of 15 km to 55 km and structural index of 0.5 along AB profile in the Zagros zone.\n    Topography map with seismic stations     Variation of Moho depth along AB profile in the Zagros Zone   ","date":1578572839,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1578572839,"objectID":"1255aacc41957446e991ac1adbde7009","permalink":"https://www.soran-prg.github.io/project/second_project/","publishdate":"2020-01-09T15:57:19+03:30","relpermalink":"/project/second_project/","section":"project","summary":"The Moho discontinuity is the boundary between the Earth's crust and the underlying mantle.
